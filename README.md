# random_num_game

A quick little game I made to initiate starting some personal projects. This is the first thing I've created outside of structured lessons. It isn't very complicated, but it required me to come up with an idea and execute its creation.

I also learned how to create git repositories and commit files.

I'm looking forward to learning more, creating, and adding to my GitHub and contributing to others.
